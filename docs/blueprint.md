- Background color: A slightly lighter shade of deep gray (#1E1E1E) for contrast and readability.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), used sparingly for highlights, interactive elements, and calls to action, suggesting high technology.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text; using a futuristic, digital-friendly font to convey a cutting-edge aesthetic.
- Use modern, glyph-style icons related to cybersecurity, such as padlocks, shields, and network symbols. Icons should be primarily electric blue (#7DF9FF) or a lighter shade of gray.
- Employ a clean and structured layout with a focus on readability. Utilize whitespace effectively to create a professional and modern feel.
- Subtle animations on hover or scroll, such as fading effects or a slight movement, to add a layer of interactivity without being distracting.
